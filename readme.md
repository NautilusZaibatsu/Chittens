#Chibis

changelog

09/01/2019 = 0.54
~ fixed a bug causing gravestones to lose momentum immediately
~ added jowls and noses. Nose colour is not genetic; lighter Chibis have pink noses. darker Chibis have black noses. Jowl colouration raises coat combinations to 4,096 (not including gradients / shading)
~ added pick and runt of litter. Picks start larger, runts start smaller, grow to a smaller size, but have more unique colours
~ Kittens now take 2 days to mature instead of 1
~ elders no longer tend graves, they just don't breed any more

02/01/2019 = 0.53
~ added FPS counter
~ improved performance
~ changed the way the front legs are drawn to make it smoother and more natural
~ kitten behaviour update. A Chibi will be a kitten until it is 1 day old. It will follow it's mother attempting to suckle until it becomes independent. Kittens sleep do not pay a cost for jumping, they sleep when their mothers do. Kittens start smaller and grow faster
~ trees now regenerate only one piece of fruit per day
~ added Egyptian names
~ added albinism and backbone of gene disorder system
~ each body part is now coloured individually, allowing for 512 combinations (not including gradients / shading)
~ added a countdown when choosing a Chibi. If the timer runs out the game will chose the currently selected Chibi, if there is no selection it will choose a random one



24/11/2018 = 0.52
~ added speech bubbles
~ trees now automatically start to drop once they reach their maximum height. This is to stop all the Chibis from starving to death if they can't reach the trees
~ made the colour range for mutations more diverse
~ changed the way Chibis look in nirvana, now it's much more dramatic
~ tweaked some appearance values to make the most of the cell shading system


23/11/2018 = 0.051
~ added cell shading to the Chibis
~ completely rewrote the way front legs work
~ tails now vary in length
~ fruit is now eaten on the floor instead of in the air when picked, this takes a short time during which the Chibi cannot act

22/11/2018 = 0.05
~ trees produce fruit, Chibis get hungry and eat the fruit. Chibis then excrete seeds grow into trees
~ reworked the kitten generation system, litters now feel more like a group of siblings

~ reworked the jumping algorithms

21/11/2018 = 0.49
~ added length to Chibi's bodies so the back end follows the front around
~ reworked front and back legs to fit the new body look
~ if you have no male or no female Chibis left you will now be returned to the appropriate cattery instead of a random Chibi spawning
~ added a stats panel for selected Chibi, you can now give away (remove from your game) Chibis from here.
